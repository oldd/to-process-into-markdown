Studying - here you are in practice zone
	what
		Studying seems simple, you sit there and learn stuff.  But that’s far from true.
		Good studying is teaching yourself. 
		Good studying requires a good plan.
		Good study plans look a lot like lesson plans.
		Good lesson plans have a focus and end product
		A focus is not only a topic and some skills, but specifies scope and levels of detail.
	how
		By creating your own lesson plan:
			Narrow the topics you need to study.
			Often, in formulating a clear question you will find your answer.
			Analyzing your list of questions, you can see:
				Am I on topic?
					Am I distracted in breadth or depth?
				What seem to be recurring confusions? 
					Can I trace those to a common source?
			Automatically building up a lesson plan for the next days.
				If you do a good job organizing your questions.
		Personal preference: I learn best if I play teacher and student. create then follow a lesson plan
	why
		Everything can be learned - even studying
		Because it is the most useful skills you will ever learn.  Think about it:
		What do you have to do to learn anything else?
		Study!
		So learn to study better and you’ll be better at everything.
